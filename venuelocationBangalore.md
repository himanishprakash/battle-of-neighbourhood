Bangalore or Bengaluru is the capital of the Indian State Karnataka is known for its pleasant climate throughout the year.
Bangalore is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India.
Alot of people shifts to Bangalore because of its advancement in IT sector and is also the hub of lot of startups. Bengaluru doesn’t just have India’s most knowledgeable coffee drinkers but also has more people who experiment with home brewing and roasting. 
India’s tryst with coffee began in the 16th Century, when Baba Budan, a Sufi cleric smuggled seven coffee beans through the port of Mocha in Yemen. He sowed these near Chikmagalur, in an area that came to be known as Baba Budan Hills, and got India hooked to this wonder-bean. 
Today, Karnataka produces more than 70% of India’s coffee and the state’s key coffee cultivation centres–Coorg, Chikmagalur and Sakleshpur—are all popular weekend getaways from the city.
In such a large and rich coffee culture city of Bangalore, it will be competitive to start up coffee business. We need to to find the hotspot to lay our coffee shop and get the maximum foot traffic and potential 
revenue.

### Business Problem

The objective of this capstone project is to analyze and select the best neighborhood in the city of Bangalore to open a new coffee shop. Using data science methodology and machine learning techniques like clustering, this project will aim to provide a solution to the question:
Which neighborhood in the city of Bangalore would a stakeholder of a coffee shop look to open a business.
Target audience of the project will be all those locals, outsiders, tourist who are in Bangalore and don't start there day without a coffee. From yougsters to senior citizens who love coffee comes under the target audience.

### Data Section

To solve the problem, we will need the following data:
First of all we need to collect Data of all coffee shops in Bangalore including their name, id, location (address, latitude, longitude) then pick up the "hot" neighbor where locates most of the venue. 
In order to asset Data we use FourSquare and apply folium for visualizing a particular neighbor in which that we will observe customer "traffic" and predict an appropriate location of new coffee shop in town.
I will use this data to perform clustering on various neighborhoods.
